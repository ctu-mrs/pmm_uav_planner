## Usage Demonstration

<!-- `main.cpp` contains a demonstration on how to use our planner. 
In the demo, we load paramaters of our planner from a planner_config yaml file, and the waypoints through which the trajectory is planned from waypoints_config yaml file.
We have prepared a sample planner config file with recommended parameters in `config/planner`.
For reference of what each parameter present in `planner_config.yaml`, have a look at our paper!
The paths we presented in our paper are located in `config/waypoints`.
The call structure is `./main path/to/planner_config_file path/to/waypoints_config_file`. -->
`main.cpp` contains a demonstration on how to use our planner. 
In the demo, the paramaters of our planner are loaded from the `planner_config.yaml` file and the waypoints, through which the trajectory is planned, are loaded from the `waypoints_config.yaml` file.
A sample planner config file with recommended parameters can be found in `config/planner`.
For more information about parameters in `planner_config.yaml` have a look at our paper!
The paths presented in our paper are located in `config/waypoints`.
The call structure is `./main path/to/planner_config_file path/to/waypoints_config_file`.

For example, to generate a trajectory for the race map, simply run:

```
./main config/planner/planner_config.yaml config/waypoints/race.yaml
```

### Trajectory Visualization

A python script is used to visualize the optimized trajectory.
We recommend creating a virtual environment and activating it using:
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Afterwards install the python dependencies using pip (or pip3 if python3 is not default):
```
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

We have prepared two scripts for visualization of resulting trajectory. Note that parameter `export::sampled_trajectory` has to be set to `true` in `planner_config.yaml`, for visualization to work.
The sampled trajectory will then be saved in `trajectory_data/` as a csv file (without header) in the format

```
t, p_x, p_y, p_z, v_x, v_y, v_z, a_x, a_y, a_z
```
where t [s] contains timestamps, (p_x, p_y, p_z) [m] is the position vector, (v_x, v_y, v_z) [m/s] is the velocity vector, and (a_x, a_y, a_z) [m/s^2] is the acceleration vector.

To visualize a 3D view of the trajectory run:
```
python3 scripts/plot_trajectory.py scripts/trajectory_data/sampled_trajectory.csv
```

To visualize position, velocity and acceleration profiles of the trajectory run:
```
python3 scripts/plot_profiles.py scripts/trajectory_data/sampled_trajectory.csv
```

You can replace `sampled_trajectory.csv` with the file containing sampled trajectory you want to visualize.
